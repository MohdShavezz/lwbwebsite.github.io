                    the Nawab as well as his mother. The interiors of the structure are beautifully ornamented with
                    chandeliers and crystal lamps brought from Belgium which earned it the moniker ‘the Palace of
                    Lights’. The exteriors feature elements of intricate Islamic calligraphy, adding to its visual
